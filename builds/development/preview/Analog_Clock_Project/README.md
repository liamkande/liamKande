# Analog clock Project Summary:

Used JavaScript and CSS to create a simple working analog clock. used objects and methods to get the current time, used variables to hold information, used methods to break that time into hours, minutes and seconds, used operators to translate that information into degrees on a circle, and used DOM element properties to position the arms correctly. The end result will be a simple, yet accurate, working analog clock.
